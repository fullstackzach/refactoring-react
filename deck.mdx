Higher order components vs. Render Props

Create a compound component 

What are these? Pros/Cons - When you should use each

---

# Higher Order Components

What are they?

* Share common functionality among components

* Mixins used to be the thing (thats so 2015 now)

* React ditched React.CreateClass in favor of native ES6 classes

---

You might recognize these

```
export default withRouter(MyComponent)
export default withTheme(MyComponent)
```

Or this iconic one

```
export default connect(
  mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps
)(MyComponent)
```
